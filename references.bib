abstract = "A measure of complexity based on a probabilistic description of physical systems is proposed. This measure incorporates the main features of the intuitive notion of such a magnitude. It can be applied to many physical situations and to different descriptions of a given system. Moreover, the calculation of its value does not require a considerable computational effort in many cases of physical interest."

abstract = {We discuss a way of characterizing probability distributions, complementing that provided by the celebrated notion of information measure, with reference to a measure of complexity that we call a “nontriviality measure”. Our starting point is the “LMC” measure of complexity advanced by López-Ruiz et al. (Phys. Lett. A 209 (1995) 321) and its analysis by Anteneodo and Plastino (Phys. Lett. A 223 (1997) 348). An improvement of some of their troublesome characteristics is thereby achieved. Basically, we replace the Euclidean distance to equilibrium by the Jensen–Shannon divergence. The resulting measure turns out to be (i) an intensive quantity and (ii) allows one to distinguish between different degrees of periodicity. We apply the “cured” measure to the logistic map so as to clearly exhibit its advantages.},
